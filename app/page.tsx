    <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. I'm mainly interested in back-end development
      and systems programming, but I'm always looking to learn new things!</p>

    <p>Currently I am working on a custom compiler written in Rust to convert my Ingot programming language to
      Minecraft's .mcfunction format.</p>

        <p className="text-content2">Thank you <ExternalLink href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/rich-stanton/">Rich
          Stanton</ExternalLink> for this wonderful article! I'm glad you enjoyed the calculator as much as I enjoyed
          making it.</p>

          This project has been incredible; I built the initial prototype several years ago after having some
          unanswered questions in my 11th grade math class. Since then, it has been featured on <ExternalLink

          Gamer"</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink

          Additionally,
          since
          its launch in March 2020, the calculator has been viewed 9.6 million times, and downloaded over 8.2 thousand
          times.

          The project was featured on 6/18/2020 on <ExternalLink
          href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-java-realms--realms-midsummer-celebration-">minecraft.net</ExternalLink> and
          subsequently been available on the Minecraft Realms subscription service.

          Through several iterations of the calculator, I've learnt a lot about data structures and algorithms, in
          addition to several numerical methods.
          I learnt a lot about floating point arithmetic while implementing it in .mcfunction, and I've learnt a lot
          about several obscure computational algorithms.
