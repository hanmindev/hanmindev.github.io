## Introduction

I wrote this guide because I was in your shoes a few years ago. I was jealous of my friends at Waterloo who already had completed multiple internships by the time I was applying for my first one.

Our job board is not as good as Waterloo's, we don't start our first official internship until after our second year, and we only get to do two. Meanwhile, Waterloo students do their first internship in first year, and do five to six internships!

It's hard to beat a school whose programs are literally built around doing as many co-ops as possible. But that doesn't mean you can't get a good internship! With some effort, luck, and prior knowledge, hopefully you'll be able to get an internship that you're happy with.

## Things to Know

Some prerequisite information that you should be familiar with before discussing strategies.

### What is a full time student?

UofT defines a full-time student as a student enrolled in 3.0 credits or more in the Fall/Winter session, or 1.5 credits or more in the Summer session. [Source](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course-enrolment)

Seems reasonable for most cases, but this can be problematic. If you decide to not take courses during either the fall or the winter semester, this means that unless you take 3.0 credits in the semester you are in school, you are not considered a full time student.

This means that if you decide to take five 0.5 credit courses in the fall, and not take any courses in the winter to do an internship, you will not be able to apply for the visa during the fall and winter!

However, the exception is if you are an ASIP student! More details in the next section.

### ASIP

[ASIP](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/experiential-learning/internships/asip), or the Arts and Sciences Internship Program, is our Co-Op program. It's relatively new (I don't think anyone has graduated with ASIP during time of writing), and a lot has changed as it settled into its place. Double-check anything people have said! ASIP has gotten much more flexible over the years, so don't be afraid to talk to them about something you've heard someone get denied for.

Typically, ASIP students do one shorter internship in the summer after second or third year (4 months), then a longer internship (8, 12, 16 months). However, if you have a job offer that doesn't fit in with the standard schedule, you can request alternate sequencing. It'll probably get approved, provided that it meets the ASIP guidelines (basically if you're getting paid, the job is relevant to your degree, and it meets the minimum hours). Some people have done their longer internship first, and some people have done multiple four-month internships.

I personally did not find the ASIP job board helpful, but many of my peers have found jobs through it. The jobs on there aren't *great* with a few exceptions, but it's definitely better than nothing especially for your first job. Don't expect too much, but it's definitely not useless!

Even if you aren't going to use the job board at all (I didn't even get to in third year because I got my internships quickly), ASIP can still come in useful, because it allows you to be a full-time student when you wouldn't otherwise.

During an ASIP work term, you will be considered a full-time student.

If in the Fall/Winter session you do one semester of school of 1.5 credits or greater, and a work term with ASIP (in either order), you will be considered a full time student for the entire session. If you weren't doing ASIP, you would have to take 3.0 credits throughout the session, meaning that if you don't want to take courses during your internship, you would have to take six courses in the semester you are at school.

#### Okay, why should I care about being a full-time student?

For international students, I believe being in an accredited university co-op program and having a full-time student status for 2/3rds of the year can be important, but I'm not too sure as I'm a Canadian citizen. If you have any information, please add it!

For Canadian Citizens and Permanent Residents, this can still be important with respect to the J-1 visa if you want to intern in the United States!

### J-1 Visa Considerations

Note: I am not an immigration lawyer nor am I claiming to have any real knowledge. Please verify all facts yourself.

Unless you are a US citizen or permanent resident, you cannot legally do an internship in the United States without an appropriate visa. If you receive an offer for a US internship, your company will likely sponsor you for a J-1 visa.

Once you have your offer, sometime between then and your start date, your company will begin the visa application. You will be given guidance throughout the process, and there are many other resources for what to expect, so I won't be going over them here.

One very important thing that you need to know is **you can only apply for the J-1 visa if you are a FULL TIME STUDENT at the time of visa application**. If you are not, you will be unable to apply for the visa, and **you may be unable to do the internship**. If you're lucky, your company may have a Canadian office, and they might send you there.

Note that due to how ASIP works (from the previous section), you can make yourself a full-time student in cases when you normally wouldn't be. Use this to your advantage to ensure that you are a full time student in the semester before you do a US internship.

In theory, because you only have to be a full time student when you apply for the J-1 visa, so if you get your offer early and the company acts quick, you could avoid having to be a full time student in the semester or even two before. However, this feels risky imo.

Consecutive US internships is possible, but you won't get the second visa until you finish your previous internship and return back to Canada. If two companies use the same visa company and are willing to collaborate, I've heard you can transfer the visa as well. See the [Unofficial Waterloo USA Intern Guide](https://stephenholiday.com/Unofficial-Waterloo-USA-Intern-Guide/) for additional information.

## Internship and Course Scheduling

Now that you have all the relevant information you need, you should start planning when you'll do your internships, and balancing it with your courses.

The following sections are divided up into school years, which start in the fall, and end in the summer (not really convention but I think it's easiest to follow for this).

### First Year

You likely don't want to do any internships during fall or winter because you need to take the required courses to make POST.

In first year, on top of the required CS courses and MAT137, definitely take MAT223 (yes it is a 200 level course, but you pretty much need to take it if you don't want to be behind), and try and finish as much of your breadth requirements as possible. You could also take CSC240 if you want, but be warned that it is a very difficult course, or so I've heard. If you're unsure, enrol in six courses with the intention of dropping one course. I would not recommend waiting till second year to take CSC240 as it is offered only in the winter, and it will push everything back.

For the summer, try and find an internship. As you're a first year with little to no experience, you'll be put at a huge disadvantage, but with some networking and a bit of luck, you might get something. You're way ahead of the curve if you've gotten something already. I would cold email people at smaller companies as referrals go a long way there.

Aside from that, there are many opportunities geared towards first and second year students such as Google STEP and Microsoft Explore, but they are quite competitive.

Alternatively, you can choose to take courses. I would try and take as many second year CS courses that are available if you want to save time. CSC207 and CSC236 (if you haven't taken CSC240) are sometimes offered over the summer, which are prerequisites for many future courses. Additionally, I would suggest taking MAT235/MAT237 (continuation of MAT137) over the summer as it will let you compress a two semester course into one semester.

You can also choose to just take a break and chill, but I think setting yourself up for success in earlier years is important.

Additionally, near the end of the winter semester ASIP applications should open up.

### Second Year

This year, you'll have to take CSC207, CSC209, CSC236, CSC263/CSC265, CSC258, and one of four statistics courses.

If you have already taken CSC207, you can take CSC209 in the fall! (if offered, it's always offered in the winter, and sometimes in the fall)

If you have already taken CSC236 or CSC240, you can take CSC263/CSC265 in the fall! Note that CSC265 is apparently the hardest course ever.

Otherwise, you can take those courses in the winter semester. Note that CSC265 is only offered in the fall.

I would recommend trying to take all the important courses in the fall, and trying to get an internship for the winter semester. This unfortunately only really works if you did CSC207, CSC236/CSC240, and MAT235/MAT237 in first year however, as if you didn't, you'll have to take CSC209, CSC263/CSC265 and MAT235/MAT237 in third year, which is going to push things back.

If you did an internship in first year so you didn't take the courses in the summer, you already have one internship so it's not that big of a worry.

Regardless of what you do however, you should do an internship in the summer. Summer is when most internships are available, and as a second year (maybe even with a previous internship), you'll finally be somewhat competitive in this market, although you're still a second year, so you're still not that competitive.

In second year, if you were admitted to ASIP, you will have the choice to tell ASIP about your internship or not (you don't have a choice if you got the job from the ASIP job board however). If you anticipate that you might be doing a US internship in the following semesters, you may want to tell ASIP about it (see above section). Or, you could just not tell them about it. ASIP doesn't require you to do an internship in second year, so not much changes if you pretend you didn't get a job (or if you actually didn't get a job). Do note that ASIP doesn't have fees for a second year summer internship (INT200), although there are minor fees for being a full time student that you might have to pay (on the order of a hundred dollars).

### Third Year and Above

At this point, there aren't that many things to worry about. You have to complete degree requirements (obviously) but it's not like first and second year, where picking the wrong courses might delay everything. You can choose to do an internship whenever you want, although again be mindful of the whole full time student status for J-1 thing.

## Internship Search

**APPLY EARLY**

I cannot stress this enough.

Many companies, especially big companies and US companies, hire **very early**, often **eight or more months** in advance. This means that for a summer internship you should be starting to send out applications in September, or even earlier.

Smaller Canadian companies usually don't hire as early. You're probably looking to apply early January for a summer internship, although you should still apply to whatever companies have postings out before then!

The ASIP job board for second years will likely not open until around January. Apply externally in the meantime, the job board doesn't have that many jobs to begin with so you'll be doing most of the applying externally anyways.

I'm not really going to go into specifics of applying and interviewing because there are a billion guides out there. However, I want to recommend a few things:

Work on impactful, long-term projects to put on your resume. If you have little to no experience, projects are the next best thing and they need to be good if you want to differentiate yourself. No tic-tac-toe app, no stock forecaster, no to-do list app, no poorly made web app, no school projects.

Grab a friend and practice doing mock interviews, both behavioral and technical. Even if you're the type of person to ace any leetcode problem, actually engaging with someone while solving the problem is a whole different thing.
