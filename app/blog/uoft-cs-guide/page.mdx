Much of this advice is specific to the St. George campus, but some may apply to other campuses as well.

This is mainly geared towards Computer Science students looking for Software Development / Engineering internships, but some of this may be relevant to other fields and people looking to do research.

# Introduction

This guide is meant for helping you maximize internship scheduling based on your situation. UofT does a few things differently from other schools which makes it extremely difficult to fit in a lot of internships, especially if you plan to do internships in the United States. If you want to minmax your internship journey but don't want to be taking a sixth or seventh year, you **must** start planning in first year.

I wrote this guide because I was in your shoes a few years ago. I was jealous of my friends at Waterloo who already had completed multiple internships by the time I was applying for my first one.

Our job board is not as good as Waterloo's, we don't start our first official internship until after our second year, and we only get to do two. Meanwhile, Waterloo students do their first internship in first year, and do five to six internships!

It's hard to beat a school whose programs are literally built around doing as many co-ops as possible. But that doesn't mean you can't get a good internship! With some effort, luck, and prior knowledge, hopefully you'll be able to get an internship that you're happy with.

# Things to Know

Some prerequisite information that you should be familiar with before discussing strategies.

## What is a full time student?

UofT defines a full-time student as a student enrolled in 3.0 credits or more in the Fall/Winter session, or 1.5 credits or more in the Summer session. [Source](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course-enrolment)

Seems reasonable for most cases, but this can be problematic. If you decide to not take courses during either the fall or the winter semester, this means that unless you take 3.0 credits in the semester you are in school, you are not considered a full time student.

This means that if you decide to take five 0.5 credit courses in the fall, and not take any courses in the winter to do an internship, you will not be a full time student during fall nor winter!

However, the exception is if you are an ASIP student! More details in the next section.

## ASIP

[ASIP](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/experiential-learning/internships/asip), or the Arts and Sciences Internship Program, is our Co-Op program. It's relatively new (I don't think anyone has graduated with ASIP during time of writing), and a lot has changed as it settled into its place. Double-check anything people have said! ASIP has gotten much more flexible over the years, so don't be afraid to talk to them about something you've heard someone get denied for.

### Scheduling

Typically, ASIP students do one shorter internship in the summer after second or third year (4 months), then a longer internship (8, 12, 16 months). However, if you have a job offer that doesn't fit in with the standard schedule, you can request alternate sequencing. It'll probably get approved, provided that it meets the ASIP guidelines (basically if you're getting paid, the job is relevant to your degree, and it meets the minimum hours). Some people have done their longer internship first, and some people have done multiple four-month internships.

Do note that they'll only let you do three 4-month internships. Essentially, once you meet the requirements for graduation with ASIP, you're forced to finish. Looking at the fact that ASIP has a 20 month (4 + 16) experience option, I asked if they'll ever let someone do five 4-month internships, and I was told that they'll probably never do that.

### Job Board

I personally did not find the ASIP job board helpful, but many of my peers have found jobs through it. The jobs on there aren't *great* with a few exceptions, but it's definitely better than nothing especially for your first job. Don't expect too much, but it's definitely not useless!

### Full-Time Student Status

Even if you aren't going to use the job board at all (I didn't even get to in third year because I got my internships quickly), ASIP can still come in useful, because it allows you to be a full-time student when you wouldn't otherwise.

During an ASIP work term, you will be considered a full-time student.

If in the Fall/Winter session you do one semester of school of 1.5 credits or greater, and a work term with ASIP (in either order), you will be considered a full time student for the entire session. If you weren't doing ASIP, you would have to take 3.0 credits throughout the session, meaning that if you don't want to take courses during your internship, you would have to take six courses in the semester you are at school.

#### Why should I care?

For international students, I believe being in an accredited university co-op program and having a full-time student status for 2/3rds of the year can be important, but I'm not too sure as I'm a Canadian citizen. If you have any information, please add it!

For Canadian Citizens and Permanent Residents, this can still be important with respect to the J-1 visa if you want to intern in the United States!

## J-1 Visa Considerations

Note: I am not an immigration lawyer nor am I claiming to have any real knowledge. Please verify all facts yourself.

Unless you are a US citizen or permanent resident, you cannot legally do an internship in the United States without an appropriate visa. If you receive an offer for a US internship, your company will likely sponsor you for a J-1 visa.

Once you have your offer, sometime between then and your start date, your company will begin the visa application. You will be given guidance throughout the process, and there are many other resources for what to expect, so I won't be going over them here.

One very important thing that you need to know is **you can only apply for the J-1 visa if you are a FULL TIME STUDENT at the time of visa application**. If you are not, you will be unable to apply for the visa, and **you may be unable to do the internship**. If you're lucky, your company may have a Canadian office, and they might send you there.

Note that due to how ASIP works (from the previous section), you can make yourself a full-time student in cases when you normally wouldn't be. Use this to your advantage to ensure that you are a full time student in the semester before you do a US internship.

In theory, because you only have to be a full time student when you apply for the J-1 visa, so if you get your offer early and the company acts quick, you could avoid having to be a full time student in the semester or even two before. However, this feels risky imo.

Consecutive US internships is possible, but you won't get the second visa until you finish your previous internship and return back to Canada. If two companies use the same visa company and are willing to collaborate, I've heard you can transfer the visa as well. See the [Unofficial Waterloo USA Intern Guide](https://stephenholiday.com/Unofficial-Waterloo-USA-Intern-Guide/) for additional information.

# Internship and Course Scheduling

Now that you have all the relevant information you need, you should start planning when you'll do your internships, and balancing it with your courses.

## How many Internships should I do?

The answer is as many as you need to be happy with your current company, maybe plus one or two if you want to beef up your resume before graduation. Whether that means one or six internships is going to depend on your goals, and what internships you get.

Recall that the most internships you can do with ASIP is three, if you choose to do three 4-month internships. However, you can still do more by doing it not through ASIP, and just taking a four-month break from school to do an internship.

It's difficult to give a schedule that'll work for everyone because there are so many variables involved. Will you be successful in getting an internship in first year? Will you choose to take courses? Do you think you have a shot at getting an internship at an American company? How many years are you willing to stay here? Are you in ASIP? Are the courses you want even offered in that semester? - just a few of numerous variables.

So, I've decided to give you a list of choices divided by year, so you can choose what's best for you given your scenario.

The following sections are divided up into school years, which start in the fall, and end in the summer (not really convention but I think it's easiest to follow for this).

## Longer Internships

8, 12, or even 16-month internships are quite common in Canada, and under the normal ASIP schedule, you would be doing this for your second work term.

However, I am personally **very** against them and would recommend that you do three 4-month internships instead (or more). I wish ASIP wasn't built in a way where long internships are the norm, but thankfully doing multiple 4-month internships is as easy as sending an email and signing some forms.

Note that I'm going to be using the concepts of doing a longer internship and doing fewer internships somewhat interchangeably because well, in the time you did a longer internship you could have done two or more.

Here are a few reasons I dislike longer internships:

1\. **Risk of being stuck with a bad company**: There are a million reasons why you might want to stop your internship early. Maybe your day-to-day tasks are irrelevant to what you want to do. Maybe your company is making you use some weird, proprietary, esoteric toolset leaving you with no transferable skills. Maybe your company hired you to exploit cheap labour subsidized by your co-op status. Maybe your company pays $20/hr, and you literally lose money doing the internship because of rent.

Regardless of the reason, the good thing about 4-month internships is that if things go bad, you'll have an exit plan. At worst, you'll only waste a semester, and you'll still have *something* to write on your resume. In contrast, if you were doing a longer 8, 12, or 16-month internship, you'd be stuck there for much longer, wasting semesters where you could have been doing an internship elsewhere.

Of course, you can choose to break contract and leave early, but there may be potential problems. If you wanted to do a longer internship, it'd be much better to do a 4-month one, then ask for an extension, if you enjoy the company.

2\. **Putting your eggs in one basket**: If you're doing a lot of shorter internships, you'll have a lot of chances. Terrible job market? Bombed your interviews? Just got plain unlucky? Well, you'll have more chances in the future. Even if you've planned your schedule around doing three 4-month internships, you can still afford to "fail" once. If you're planning to do something like five, even better.

However, with longer internships you have less chances. Got a long internship that you don't really like? Well you can try again in the future but not really without delaying your graduating even further.

3\. **Less to fall back to**: One of my biggest jealousies of my friends at Waterloo is the fact that because they've done so many internships, they've built quite the network with people at different companies. Naturally, having done multiple internships, they'll meet more people, and get a lot of proper networking done (not just adding random people on LinkedIn or talking to someone once).

One of my friends talked about how at the end of his internship, his manager told him to shoot him an email if he ever wants to come back after graduating. By doing more internships, you'll get more of these opportunities in case you can't find anything as a new grad (I've heard finding jobs as a new grad is a whole other level).

So if you've done five 4-month internships, you might have a couple companies that you actually liked working at and would like to go back. Even if your first job sucked, your last job didn't give you a return offer, and you didn't like the work you did at one, you'll at least have two candidates.

If you've done one 4-month internship and one 16-month internship, good luck if you didn't like your first job and the second one didn't give you a return offer ðŸ’€.

4\. **Less chances to climb**: One of the biggest advantages to the Waterloo system is that you can climb your way up on every internship. With more and more experience under your belt, every time you apply, you'll have a greater chance of receiving an offer at a better company. Your second internship will probably be better than your first, and your third internship will probably be better than your second. But if you only do two because one of them is longer, in the same time as someone else who's jumped up twice, or even more if you're doing a longer internship, you'll only be able to jump up once.

5\. **Most big companies don't even do more than 4 months**: Most big tech companies don't even do long internships. Some companies will let you extend a 4-month internship, but regardless you'll still have to apply for a 4-month position. This is especially troubling given the fact that a lot of these companies won't even read your resume if you don't have a previous internship. So if you want to do a 4-month internship, then a longer one, you kind of can't work at a big company with a few exceptions.

6\. **More Breadth**: I believe that as a student, you should be looking for breadth, rather than depth. You should look around and explore as much as possible to see what you like, what you don't like, what you're good at, etc. Being a student presents a unique opportunity where you can hop internships every 4 months several times and no one will bat an eye - try doing that after you graduate, see what recruiters think.

Once you graduate, even if you job hop, you'll probably have to stay at one company for longer before doing so, and I would assume that it is more difficult to transition to a widely different section of the industry as well (note: this is purely speculation, but I think it does make sense). Meanwhile, many internship opportunities don't look too closely at your specific skills, but rather evaluate your potential to learn, meaning that as long as you can show that you're capable of learning, it should be easy to switch.

There are so many things you can do with a Computer Science degree. Even something more specific like "backend development" has so many subfields. If you're going to focus on a specific area, I would rather know what's out there than blindly go into something because I didn't like my first internship and what I did in my second internship was okay.

Yes both depth and breadth are important, but you'll eventually gain depth anyways if you're going to work in this industry until you retire.

## Fall, Winter, Summer

Most people refer to internships in the fall and/or winter as "off season", with the main season for internships being the summer. There are, quite literally, hundreds of times more internship listings in the summer than the fall and winter **combined**. Many companies exclusively have summer internships, and many companies which have off-season internships will take way fewer students than in the summer. I have also heard that some companies' off-season internships aren't as good as the summer internships as well.

So I think if possible, you should aim to do an internship over each summer. It's not like there's much you can do anyways - the number of computer science courses (or well, any courses) offered during the summer is pitiful (there are a few 200-level CSC courses offered in the summer, CSC311 and CSC384 are pretty much the only 300+ level courses offered in the summer).

You should still look for off-season internships as well. I heard from a friend that UBC co-op recommends their students do their first co-op in the winter, because it is much less competitive than the summer. So perhaps you could squeeze in a winter coop during second year (read more below on how to do this, you need to plan ahead if you want to do this!).

If you're lucky, it's possible that you get multiple offers for the summer, and one of the companies lets you push the internship to a different season. For example, if you got two summer internships, you could try and move one to the fall. This is highly dependent on the company; some companies don't push internships and will ask you to apply again, and some don't do off-season internships at all.

## First Year

You likely don't want to do any internships during fall or winter because you need to take the required courses to make POST.

In first year, on top of the required CS courses and MAT137, definitely take MAT223 (yes it is a 200 level course, but you pretty much need to take it if you don't want to be behind), and try and finish as much of your breadth requirements as possible. You could also take CSC240 if you want, but be warned that it is a very difficult course, or so I've heard. If you're unsure, enrol in six courses with the intention of dropping one course. I would not recommend waiting till second year to take CSC240 as it is offered only in the winter, and it will push everything back.

In the fall, if you are in-stream you'll take CSC110. It is a full credit course, meaning that in theory it has double the workload of a normal course. However, I've personally found it to be no different from a normal course, maybe even easier. Because this is a full credit course, some may suggest taking only four courses in the fall. I highly disagree and think you should take five. If it's too much for you, you can always drop one course without penalty, provided that it's before the drop deadline.

For the summer, try and find an internship. As you're a first year with little to no experience, you'll be put at a huge disadvantage, but with some networking and a bit of luck, you might get something. You're way ahead of the curve if you've gotten something already. I would cold email people at smaller companies as referrals go a long way there.

Aside from that, there are many opportunities geared towards first and second year students such as Google STEP and Microsoft Explore, but they are quite competitive.

Alternatively, you can choose to take courses. I would try and take as many second year CS courses that are available if you want to save time. CSC207 and CSC236 (if you haven't taken CSC240) are sometimes offered over the summer, which are prerequisites for many future courses. Additionally, I would suggest taking MAT235/MAT237 (continuation of MAT137) over the summer as it will let you compress a two semester course into one semester.

You can also choose to just take a break and chill, but I think setting yourself up for success in earlier years is important.

Additionally, near the end of the winter semester ASIP applications should open up.

## Second Year

This year, you'll have to take CSC207, CSC209, CSC236, CSC263/CSC265, CSC258, and one of four statistics courses.

If you have already taken CSC207, you can take CSC209 in the fall! (if offered, it's always offered in the winter, and sometimes in the fall)

If you have already taken CSC236 or CSC240, you can take CSC263/CSC265 in the fall! Note that CSC265 is apparently the hardest course ever.

Otherwise, you can take those courses in the winter semester. Note that CSC265 is only offered in the fall.

I would recommend trying to take all the important courses in the fall, and trying to get an internship for the winter semester. This unfortunately only really works if you did CSC207, CSC236/CSC240, and MAT235/MAT237 in first year however, as if you didn't, you'll have to take CSC209, CSC263/CSC265 and MAT235/MAT237 in third year, which is going to push things back.

If you did an internship in first year so you didn't take the courses in the summer, you already have one internship so it's not that big of a worry.

If you take CSC263 in the fall, you can take CSC373 in the winter.

If you take CSC209 + CSC258 in the fall, you can take CSC369 in the winter.

Regardless of what you do however, you should do an internship in the summer. Summer is when most internships are available, and as a second year (maybe even with a previous internship), you'll finally be somewhat competitive in this market, although you're still a second year, so you're still not that competitive.

In second year, if you were admitted to ASIP, you will have the choice to tell ASIP about your internship or not (you don't have a choice if you got the job from the ASIP job board however). If you anticipate that you might be doing a US internship in the following semesters, you may want to tell ASIP about it (see above section).

Or, you could just not tell them about it. ASIP doesn't require you to do an internship in second year, so not much changes if you pretend you didn't get a job (or if you actually didn't get a job). If you want to save one of your work terms for later, this is a good option.

Do note that ASIP doesn't have fees for a second year summer internship (INT200), although there are minor fees for being a full time student that you might have to pay (on the order of a hundred dollars).

## Third Year and Above

At this point, there aren't that many things to worry about. You have to complete degree requirements (obviously) but it's not like first and second year, where picking the wrong courses might delay everything. You can choose to do an internship whenever you want, although again be mindful of the whole full time student status for J-1 thing.

Also take into note that some 300/400 level courses aren't offered every year. Some of the more niche courses are offered only every other year, and only in specific semesters, so if there's a course you're interested in, do your research and plan ahead!

# Applying for Internships

## Getting Ready

Now that you know when you're going to do your internships, it's time to get ready to apply. This means you'll need a resume.

If you don't have any past experience, you're resume is going to look quite empty. If you're a first or second year, you already have a huge disadvantage so you need a way to differentiate yourself. You can join clubs (please actually do stuff so you'll have things to talk about on your resume), attend hackathons (with the intent of winning! Prepare well!), and working on projects.

I can't really talk much about clubs because I haven't joined any except like... anime club.

### Hackathons

Hackathons are events where you'll often be given some sort of theme, and you have typically a day or a weekend to make a project. Most hackathons are geared towards first and second years, and many even accept high school students! My friends and I have been doing hackathons since high school, so once university rolled around, we knew what to do and won a couple awards.

A huge thing at hackathons are the sponsors. There will be a lot of companies at the event, so make sure to talk to them and maybe you'll even land an interview! Even if you don't, you'll have a sick company t-shirt (I only wear hackathon t-shirts ðŸ˜­).

There are many hackathons everywhere. UofT has UoftHacks which happens around January, so don't miss that.

Waterloo has Hack the North in September, and you do not want to miss this. Huge event, sponsors from huge companies, lots of people. Admission is free and they'll bring over a couple busses to drive everyone from Toronto down to Waterloo. They also have places to sleep although if you're like me, you'll be sleeping on some random table you found with a sleeping bag.

### Projects

Work on impactful, long-term projects to put on your resume. If you have little to no experience, projects are the next best thing, and they need to be good if you want to differentiate yourself.

No tic-tac-toe app, no stock forecaster that uses "AI and ML" that barely works, no chatgpt wrapped project, no to-do list app, no poorly made web app, no school projects. You need to differentiate yourself so make something unique, and ideally actually useful. It's not exactly easy coming up with unique ideas, so think about it for a while. I personally like working on tools that I can see myself using, because not only is it easier to think of (think of a few annoyances in your life that you could automate), you'll also be motivated to finish it, so you can use the tool.

#### Group Projects

Group projects are a good way to make a very impressive project, but you should make sure your group members actually want to make the project and don't just like the idea of having a project. At best, you'll just end up doing everything. At worst, you'll be slowed down by people who say they'll do something but they forget about it for a month so you can't proceed and after waiting a month you end up doing it anyways.

### Writing the Resume

Be specific, and use the [xyz resume format](https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.html), which says your points should be in the form: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]."

"But my project doesn't have numerical stats!", well find something to measure. Performance improvements can be easy to measure, or maybe you can write about the number of users if your website is gaining traction. Maybe you could write about how much time your tool saves you in your day-to-day life. It can be anything.

Did I mention you should be specific? If someone can copy your resume points, change a word or two (C++ -> Python, Company A -> Company B) and still have an accurate resume, your points suck. So many people's resumes effectively boil down to "I did some stuff". What is some stuff? I don't care that you used Python and pandas to read data, I want to know the details of what you did. How did you use pandas? What considerations did you have while implementing a function?

If your points are too broad, I'd recommend picking one specific concrete thing you did and writing about it.

#### Examples
**(these may not actually make sense, this is mainly to show how much better the points can get)**

"Used Python and Pandas to pre-process machine learning training data to improve consistency by 78%" -> "Improved consistency of machine learning training data by 78% by adding a preprocessing step using Pandas to invalidate malformed data points and log them for manual review"

"Boosted performance by 2x by using custom patches on X library" -> "Boosted end-to-end encrypted message passing performance by 2x by patching X library's encryption function to use an optimized implementation of the hashing algorithm"

"Made the processing step 18x faster by rewriting parts of the code in Rust" -> "Increased data normalization processing speed by 18x by rewriting the data matrix solver in Rust"

I think the "improved" examples could still use a little work, but I'm sure you can tell that they're a lot better.

## Internship Search

I cannot stress this enough. **APPLY EARLY!!!**

Many companies, especially big companies and US companies, hire **very early**, often **eight or more months** in advance. This means that for a summer internship you should be starting to send out applications in September, or even earlier.

Smaller Canadian companies usually don't hire as early. You're probably looking to apply early January for a summer internship, although you should still apply to whatever companies have postings out before then!

The ASIP job board for second years will likely not open until around January. Apply externally in the meantime, the job board doesn't have that many jobs to begin with so you'll be doing most of the applying externally anyways.

I recommend using [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/) to speed up filling out applications. For your first job you might have to apply to hundreds before you even get an interview, so this will help out a lot.

### Online Assessments / Take Homes

A lot of companies will give you an online assessment or a take home project before giving you an interview. Some companies give OAs automatically to everyone (auto oa) then review your resume if you did well on it, or some companies review your resume first, then give you the assessment.

OAs differ by company, and by role, but often it's going to be leetcode-style problems. I can't say much aside from practice!

* If you get an OA on a website called CodeSignal, check if the name of the test is "General Coding Assessment" or something along those lines. If so, it means that your OA is using a general, non company specific assessment, for which you can reuse the results. However be aware that there is a [cooldown period](https://support.codesignal.com/hc/en-us/articles/11635510785047-What-is-a-cooldown-period-and-how-does-it-impact-my-ability-to-take-an-assessment) before you can take the assessment again, so you might be forced to send a previous result, which can be bad if you've bombed one. Try not to bomb it.

Take homes are usually going to be pretty unique. This seems to be pretty common with startups because they want to see that you can actually build something.
